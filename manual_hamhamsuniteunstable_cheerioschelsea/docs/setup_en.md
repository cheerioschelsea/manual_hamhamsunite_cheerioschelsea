# Hamtaro: Ham Hams Unite! Manual Randomizer Setup Guide

## Required Software

- Legal copy of Hamtaro: Ham Hams Unite! for GBC
- [Archipelago](https://archipelago.gg)

## Installation Procedures

Add the `.apworld` to your `custom_worlds` folder.  From the Archipelago Luancher, select Generate Template Options to create a template `.yaml`.  Edit the `.yaml` with the options you'd like.  Alternatively, if the author provides a template `.yaml`, you can edit that instead of generating one.

## Joining a MultiWorld Game

Ensure whomever is generating the MultiWorld has a copy of this `.apworld` and a copy of your customized `.yaml`.  After the seed has been generated, connect to the MultiWorld server using the Manual Client.  It is also recommended to have [Universal Tracker](https://github.com/FarisTheAncient/Archipelago/releases) installed to help with logic highlighting.  Then, play the game!  As you check locations in the game, you manually select them in the client to send the check to the server.  If another player sends you an item, you now have access to this in your game.

## Multiplayer Manual

Manual is based on the honour system.  It is up to you, the player of the Manual AP World, to restrict yourself in what items you are using in the game you are playing.

## Game Troubleshooting

If you come across any issues or bugs, feel free to reach out to the AP World's creator in the Manual for Archipelago discord server, under "Games in Manual".  Alternatively, you can submit an "Issue" here on GitHub.  Please, do NOT submit a Pull Request without speaking to the author first!
